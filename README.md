1. Introduction (Overview) 

ChefsUp is a professional community website for chefs. It allows users to create a public profile, connect with other users, and to search for job vacancies in the culinary industry. One can also create a company page detailed with information similar to a personal profile; this allows a user to post job vacancies. The aim of the site is to connect chefs with each other, and with job opportunities. 

2. High level functionality 

ChefsUp has two user types, chefs and admin users with banning and editing power. Firstly, a user will land on a homepage and be presented with the options of either signing up for an account or logging in.  

Once logged in, the user can: 
- Search for and view other chef/company profiles. 
- View job vacancies. 
- Message others. 
- Connect and/or follow other profiles. 
- View their network of connections. 
- Post Updates. 
- Fill out their profile with images, information on experience/education, skills, and other short paragraphs in an ‘about’ section.  
- View recommended job vacancies (based on skills). 
- Create a company profile. 

Through running a company profile, the user can use many of the site’s features through it, similar to a personal profile e.g. Fill it out with information, message others, post updates. A company profile though also allows for the posting of job vacancies and inserting information such as “No. of employees”.
